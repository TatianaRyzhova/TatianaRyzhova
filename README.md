## Hi there! 🙋🏻‍♀️

### I'm Tatiana and I'm a Frontend Engineer ✨

I have been working in the IT area for more than 6 years. 
I started my journey with software testing, however, I was always interested in product development.
Finally, I've made a decision to change my specialty to Frontend Engineer. 

FE is just magic, it attracts me because you can get the result immediately. You can see the app from the end-user perspective.
Also, FE gives you a place for creativity: colors, animations...

Currently, I work as a Frontend Engineer and I have a strong desire to develop my professional skills in this area and just to move forward!
